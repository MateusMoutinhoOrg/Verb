# Contribution Rules

Rules to follow when contributing to this project. Every file must also be shaped by the specification that governs it — locate it in [Specs.md](/docs/References/Specs.md).

---

## Tutorials Guide
Before making anything, read the [README.md](/README.md) and search for a tutorial about what you want to do. If there is one, follow it; if there isn't, you need to create one following the spec defined in [TutorialDocs](./Meta/TutorialDocs/).


## Specification Compliance

Before creating or editing any file, read [Specs.md](/docs/References/Specs.md) and check whether the file matches an **Applies To** entry. If it does, create or edit it following the specification that entry points to — reproduce the shape it requires, using its `sample` as reference.

---

## Sandbox Isolation

[sandbox/](/sandbox/) is a closed sandbox. No file inside it may import [adapters/](/adapters/), [examples/](/examples/), a third-party module, or an OS-bound standard-library package (`os`, `net`, `os/exec`, `syscall`, …). Every such effect must be declared as a function field on the `Deps` contract and reached through `l.Deps`, following [AddDependency.md](/docs/Tutorials/AddDependency.md). The mechanic is explained in [SandboxIsolation.md](/docs/Explanations/SandboxIsolation.md).

Contracts are **structs of function fields**, never interfaces — in [sandbox/contracts/deps](/sandbox/contracts/deps/) and [sandbox/contracts/api](/sandbox/contracts/api/) alike. Every type in the project is declared in `sandbox/contracts/`; [sandbox/internal/](/sandbox/internal/) declares no types at all. See [StructContracts.md](/docs/Explanations/StructContracts.md).

---

## Factory Pattern

Every struct of function fields in this project — an `api` struct inside the sandbox, a `deps.Deps` filled by an adapter outside it — is filled by **factories**, never by methods bound into fields and never by an internal mirror type. When you write or edit any file holding `<Field>Factory` functions, follow the [Factories](./Meta/Factories/Specs.md) specification on top of the one governing that file's tree.

A factory takes a pointer to the **carrier** — the struct holding the state the closure reads — and returns exactly one field's value; the caller assigns it:

```go
// sandbox/internal/lib/ — the carrier is the api struct being filled
func SetFactory(l *api.Lib) func(key string, value string, ttlSeconds int) {
	return func(key string, value string, ttlSeconds int) {
		l.Deps.Store(key, value, l.Deps.Now().Unix()+int64(ttlSeconds))
	}
}

func New(d deps.Deps) api.Lib {
	l := api.Lib{Deps: d}
	l.Set = SetFactory(&l)
	return l
}

// adapters/<name>/ — the carrier is the adapter, whose Deps field is the contract
func NowFactory(s *StandardAdapter) func() time.Time {
	return func() time.Time { return time.Now() }
}

func New() deps.Deps {
	s := &StandardAdapter{}
	s.Deps.Now = NowFactory(s)
	return s.Deps
}
```

Four rules follow, and none of them is checked by the compiler:

- Every api struct whose behavior needs dependencies declares a `Deps deps.Deps` field, and closures reach dependencies through it — `l.Deps.<Field>(...)`, read inside the closure, never captured at factory time. Every adapter struct declares the same field, as the contract its factories fill.
- Every field factory must be called and its return value assigned from its package's `New(...)` constructor, which is the factory aggregate — there is no separate `Factory` function. A field no factory fills stays nil and panics on first call.
- A `New` constructor returns the filled **contract struct** by value — `api.Lib`, `api.<Object>`, or `adapter.Deps` — never the carrier type of an adapter.
- The `Deps` field is **read-only once the struct is returned**: closures capture the struct the factories ran over, so a caller patching `Deps` on a copy changes nothing. Patch the `deps.Deps` value before calling `lib.New`.

Conversely, nothing outside the sandbox may reach into it beyond its three public packages: `sandbox` (package `lib`), `sandbox/contracts/deps`, and `sandbox/contracts/api`.

## Import Aliases

Any file that **consumes** the library from outside it — [examples/](/examples/), the adapter in `bootstrap/` that wires the embedded lib, and third-party consumers — imports it under `agnos`-prefixed aliases, so each call site says which layer it belongs to:

| Import | Alias |
|--------|-------|
| `adapters/<name>` | `agnosadapter` |
| `sandbox` | `agnoslib` |
| `sandbox/contracts/api` | `agnostypes` |
| `sandbox/contracts/deps` | `agnosdeps` |

```go
import (
	agnosadapter "github.com/MateusMoutinhoOrg/Agnos/adapters/standard"
	agnoslib "github.com/MateusMoutinhoOrg/Agnos/sandbox"
	agnostypes "github.com/MateusMoutinhoOrg/Agnos/sandbox/contracts/api"
)
```

An embedding library follows the same shape with its own prefix (`bootstrapadapter`, `bootstraplib`) when it is itself consumed. Files that belong to the library — everything under `sandbox/` and its own [adapters/](/adapters/) — keep the plain package names (`api`, `deps`): there the prefix would be noise, since the import is already local.

## File Changes

Before creating, deleting, or renaming any file or directory, read [Structure.md](/docs/References/Structure.md) and check whether the change affects the project structure. If it does, update [Structure.md](/docs/References/Structure.md) in the same commit.

---

## Specification Changes

When you create, delete, or rename a specification inside [Meta/](./Meta), you MUST adapt all the files that match the spec's Applies To rule, and update the index in [Specs.md](/docs/References/Specs.md).

---

## Documentation Changes

When you create, delete, or rename a `.md` file, update the Doc Index of [README.md](/README.md).

---

## Sample Changes

When you create, delete, or rename a sample (any file inside [examples/](/examples/)), update the Samples section of [README.md](/README.md).
