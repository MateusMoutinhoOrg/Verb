# ExplanationDocs Specification

## Description
Defines the required shape of an **Explanation** page — any `.md` file under `docs/Explanations/`. An explanation page describes how a mechanic, feature, or ability of the project works, building understanding rather than listing items or prescribing steps.

### Rules
- Every page must comply with [GeneralDoc](/docs/References/Meta/GeneralDoc/Specs.md).
- Each `##` section must explain a single aspect of the topic.
- Code examples are illustrative: complete and runnable where possible, with inline comments highlighting what the section explains.
- Explanation pages must not contain step-by-step procedures — link to the relevant page in `docs/Tutorials/` instead.
- Every new page must be registered in the [README.md](/README.md) Doc Index.

## Structure
1. **Title** (H1): the mechanic or feature being explained.
2. **`## Description`**: one short paragraph on what the page explains.
3. **One `##` section per aspect**, separated by `---`, each combining prose with illustrative code examples where useful.

> **Note**: For a concrete example, refer to [sample.md](/docs/References/Meta/ExplanationDocs/sample.md).
